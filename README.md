# crud-node

CRUD simple project with Express and Mongo.

With the objective of having Full-Stack knowledge I am working on this simple project while following an online course. I am creating simple CRUD operations to manage a collection of books. The app will allow to create users and add books to the collection.

I will add a folder containing the endpoints to test with Postman locally.

It is made using Express.js, Mongoose and MongoDB.
